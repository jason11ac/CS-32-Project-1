SnakePit type game

Classic snakepit game where player navigates a grid trying to kill every snake while also not landing on the same spot as a snake. The player can only move up, down, left or right and will jump snakes automatically if one is next to the player in the direction of movement. The snakes move a randomly chosen direction each turn and can not move diagonally either.
